# Analysis-of-COVID19-Using-SQL
The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant global crisis that claimed lives and negatively impacted the economy. In this micro project, I analyzed COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset, covering recorded cases from February 24, 2020, to April 30, 2021, was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).  

The dataset includes details on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. For simplicity, I split it into two separate Excel files: CovidDeaths, which contains data on cases and deaths, and CovidVaccinations, which focuses on vaccination and testing records. The entire SQL project was executed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 

The SQL query file is available in the project documents folder.  

The primary goal of this project was to apply fundamental SQL skills to analyze a real-world scenario, the COVID-19 outbreak.
